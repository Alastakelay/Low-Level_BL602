# Low-Level_BL602
This project aims to document and shed light on parts of the BouffaloLab602 [32-bit Wifi+BLE RV32IMAFC_Zifencei_Zicsr RISC-V SiFive E24 Core] microcontroller through practical examples written in Assembly

This Repository was created out of frustration due to a general lack of good documentation and practical bare-metal code examples for an otherwise amazing RISC-V embedded chip
My goal is to change this bit by byte by providing clean Assembly code through which the reader can get an understanding of how exactly he or she is supposed to interface with internals and peripherals through memory-mapped IO
I will try to incrementally grow this collection of small programs and maintain it with my best efforts
All example code is tested and run on the Pinecone (a BL602 evaluation board developed by Pine64)
